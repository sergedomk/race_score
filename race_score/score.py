It's hard to award the top participants without knowing who those participants
are. For most race events, these would be to top 3 male and female participants.
Quite a few events will also award the top 3 in each age group.

Participants, who care about placement, want to know where they placed
regardless of whether or not they win an award. For some, even their placement
in specific splits is important to them (e.g., triathlon swim, bike, and
run splits).
